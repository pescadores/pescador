Pescador is a library for streaming (numerical) data, primarily for use in machine learning applications.

Pescador addresses the following use cases:

    - **Hierarchical sampling**
    - **Out-of-core learning**
    - **Parallel streaming**

These use cases arise in the following common scenarios:

    - Say you have three data sources `(A, B, C)` that you want to sample.
      For example, each data source could contain all the examples of a particular category.

      Pescador can dynamically interleave these sources to provide a randomized stream `D <- (A, B, C)`.
      The distribution over `(A, B, C)` need not be uniform: you can specify any distribution you like!

    - Now, say you have 3000 data sources, each of which may contain a large number of samples.  Maybe that's too much data to fit in RAM at once.

      Pescador makes it easy to interleave these sources while maintaining a small `working set`.
      Not all sources are simultaneously active, but Pescador manages the working set so you don't have to.
      This way, you can process the full data set *out of core*, but using a bounded
      amount of memory.

    - If loading data incurs substantial latency (e.g., due to accessing storage access
      or pre-processing), this can be a problem.

      Pescador can seamlessly move data generation into a background process, so that your main thread can continue working.


To make this all possible, Pescador provides the following utilities:

    - :ref:`Streamer` objects encapsulate data generators for reuse, infinite sampling, and inter-process
      communication.
    - :ref:`Mux` objects allow flexible sampling from multiple streams
    - :ref:`ZMQStreamer` provides parallel processing with low communication overhead
    - Transform or modify streams with Maps (see :ref:`processing-data-streams`)
    - Buffering of sampled data into fixed-size batches (see :ref:`pescador.buffer_stream`)
