'''\
Defines the interface and several varieties of *mux*. A *mux* is
a `Streamer` which wraps N other `Streamer` objects, and at every step yields a
sample from one of its sub-streamers.

This module defines the following Mux types:

`StochasticMux`
    A Mux which chooses its active streams stochastically, and chooses
    samples from the active streams stochastically. `StochasticMux` is equivalent
    to the `pescador.Mux` from versions <2.0.

     `StochasticMux` has a `mode` parameter which selects how it operates, with
     the following modes:

    `with_replacement`

        Sample streamers with replacement.  This allows a single stream to
        be used multiple times simultaneously.

    `exhaustive`

        Each streamer is consumed at most once and never
        re-activated.

    `single_active`

        Each stream in the candidate pool is either active or not.
        Streams are revived when they are exhausted.
        This setting makes it so that streams in the
        active pool are *uniquely* selected from the candidate pool, where as
        `with_replacement` allows the same stream to be used more than once.

`ShuffledMux`
    A `ShuffledMux` interleaves samples from all given streamers.


`RoundRobinMux`
    Iterates over all the streamers in strict order.

`ChainMux`
    As in itertools.chain(), runs the first streamer to exhaustion, then
    the second, then the third, etc. Uses only a single stream at a time.
